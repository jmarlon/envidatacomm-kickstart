# About

My research focuses on the physical and social dimensions of extreme weather events and natural hazards. I use paleo and modern data along with models to understand how long-term variations in fire occurrence are controlled by changes in climate, vegetation, and human activities; this in turn provides a foundation for understanding fire feedbacks to the climate system. On the social side, I use survey data to study public risk perceptions of weather and climate, focusing currently on hurricanes and heat waves.
